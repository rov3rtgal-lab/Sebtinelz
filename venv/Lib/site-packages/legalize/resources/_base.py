"""Resource base classes.

Resources are bound to a client instance at construction. They never
build requests themselves beyond assembling params and the path —
transport, auth and retries live on the client.

Resources depend on a minimal :class:`ClientProtocol` rather than the
concrete :class:`legalize.Legalize` class. This keeps the module-level
dependency graph a DAG (resources → protocol; client → resources) with
no cyclic import, while still giving resources the exact method they
need in a fully typed way.
